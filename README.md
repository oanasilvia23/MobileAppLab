An app developed for my Mobile Applications discipline

The project that I'm developing is an application that tracks the worked hours of the employees for a company.

- in order to use the app, the user must login first;
- the user will be provided with an email address and a password (the password can be changed after the first login)

Homescreen
- the user will be presented with a list of the tasks he is currently assigned to
- the user can mark them as complete (a button), and they will disappear from the list
- he can also view the total of worked hours for current month
- at the bottom of the screen he can view a chart, with the worked hours per day (from current month)
- a Sign-out button will be available at the top of the screen

Task
- when taping on a task, the user can see: time estimated for finishing the task and the time spent on the task
- there will also be an 2 inputs and a button, where the he can log a new time entry for that day, with a breif description of his/her work

Chart
